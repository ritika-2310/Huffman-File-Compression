# Huffman-File-Compression
A C++ implementation of Huffman coding for efficient,lossless file compression.Reads text files, builds frequency tables, generates optimal Huffman codes and writes compressed binary output.Demonstrates priority queues, binary trees, and file handling.Ideal for learning core data structures, compression algorithms and practical file I/O operations.
